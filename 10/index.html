    Activity Description (Project planning):

    * Provide a brief overview of the purpose and intended audience for your
      site.
    * CSS and "look" - Describe your choices for colors, fonts, layout. Why did
      you select these?  This is a coding project too.
    * Include all the basics such as comments and error free code. Use the
      assignment elements and tags to make your planning page professional, too.
    * The stylesheet for this outline should show the look-and-feel of your
      proposed site - colors, layout, that you will use throughout your project
      site.
    * List the search engine optimization (SEO) keywords that you will use in
      the head <meta> element. Do a search using these keywords to ensure that
      the other sites that come up are similar to you planned site. Include
      links to 2 sites that were “found” by that search.
    * Add information to improve the viewer experience and to increase the
      probability that your site will be "found" in searches that are
      appropriate to your content.
    * Use all these elements and tags within your project page.

            <h2>Purpose and Audience</h2>
            <p>This site is a landing page for a firm specializing in cat rental
            and leasing for large enterprises.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>CSS Theme</h2>
            <p>The goal of the CSS theme is to frame and organize the content.  The theme should help the content appear professional and absolutely 100% serious.  To subconsciously influence the viewer's perception of the brand, the design should incorporate elements that evoke a sense of luxury, sophistication, safety, reliability, and trustworthiness.  It should look as though it was very expensive to design and build.  It should probably be literally expensive to design and build, using licensed assets and typography that are rarely if ever seen on the public web.</p>
            <p>Layout: standard sticky hero with navbar / hamburger menu.</p>
            <p>Color scheme: Based on the coat of a blue pointed Neva Masquerade cat.</p>
            <p>Fonts: Headers will use an expensive-looking calligraphic font such as <a href="https://fonts.google.com/share?selection.family=Italianno">Italianno</a> or <a href="https://www.myfonts.com/collections/desirable-calligraphy-font-alcode">Desirable Calligraphy</a>.  Sections describing the enterprise reliability features should use a more industrial-looking font, evoking heavy duty equipment built to highly reliable standards.  Most text should use a neutral business-oriented font that's easy to read, such as <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat">Monteserrat</a>.</p>
            <p>SEO keywords: cat rental, enterprise solutions, luxury pet services.</p>
