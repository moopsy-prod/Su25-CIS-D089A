    * In a new coding project, demonstrate requirements using all the
    appropriate elements and property tags within your project. For this coding
    project - Make your styling really visible. Make it standout so it is clear
    what you have added.
    * In the top portion of your project page, include some text and images
    without any styling, just using the browsers defaults.
    * In the bottom portion of your project page, add the same text and images
    and add styling using style coding in your css file.

    Some browsers and user preferences may not display your styling. It is
    helpful to include information about the requirement being demonstrated
    in the page display as well as in the comments.
